> "Technical rigor as a differentiating selling proposition"

SyntroJS differentiates itself through total transparency in code quality:

### Quality Commitments:

1. **>90% Code Coverage** - Unit + Integration tests
2. **>85% Mutation Score** - Tests that truly validate logic, not just superficial coverage
3. **Zero Known Vulnerabilities** - Automated security audits
4. **Public Quality Reports** - Public mutation testing reports on each release

### Implementation:

### Strategic Value:

This level of transparency positions SyntroJS as a **production-trusted option** from v1.0.0, differentiating us from frameworks that only report traditional coverage.

**Target:** Enterprise adoption and mission-critical projects.
